DESCRIPTION:
This project is developed as part of CODTECH Internship – Task 4, which focuses on building a Recommendation System using Collaborative Filtering techniques. Recommendation systems are widely used in real-world applications such as movie streaming platforms, e-commerce websites, and music applications to suggest relevant items to users based on their preferences.

The main objective of this task is to design a system that analyzes user behavior and recommends items by identifying similarities between users. In this project, a user-item rating dataset is used to create a user-item interaction matrix, where rows represent users and columns represent items. Ratings provided by users are used to understand their preferences.

To generate recommendations, cosine similarity is applied to measure how similar users are to each other. Based on this similarity, the system recommends items that similar users have liked but the target user has not interacted with yet. This approach allows the system to provide personalized recommendations without requiring explicit item features.

The performance of the recommendation system is evaluated using an evaluation metric such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), which helps measure the accuracy of predicted ratings. The results demonstrate that collaborative filtering is an effective technique for generating meaningful recommendations.

This project showcases the practical implementation of recommendation systems using Python and demonstrates how collaborative filtering techniques can be applied to solve real-world problems.
